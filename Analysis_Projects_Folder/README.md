# Module 7 - Employee Database with SQL

## Overview of Project
Perform an analysis of the employees elgible for retirement by title.
Determine if there will be anough retirees to mentor employees who will be replacing them.

## Results (Four major points from the two analysis deliverables)
* [Atomic:] There are a large number of employees that are eligible for retirment.
			For the list of titles of the retirement eligible employees ranked, see this image: (https://github.com/lykkelig/UofM-Data-Viz-Analytics-Boot-Camp/blob/main/Analysis_Projects_Folder/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/Resources/Retiring_Titles.png) 
* [Atomic:]	There are a number of titles that are eligible for mentorship, see this 
			image: (https://github.com/lykkelig/UofM-Data-Viz-Analytics-Boot-Camp/blob/main/Analysis_Projects_Folder/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/Resources/Mentorship_Eligible_by_Title.png).  
* [Atomic:] Engineer and Senior engineer are the titles that may be the most difficult 	
			to fill becuase of the experience level. These two groups have potential retirement candidates at 34, 559 and 29,415, respectively.
* [Atomic:] Only six managers are in the prospectie list of retirees. 


## Summary
How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
* [Atomic:] These are the roles that are going to need to be filled:

			Since only 6 of these are managers it leads one to beleive the management staff is quite lean or inexperienced. If inexperienced, the senior level managers need to get a program in place ASAP to get these managers trained on a mentorship program. 

Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
* [Atomic:] Yes, currently there are more than enough retirement-ready employees to 
			mentor the next generation. The management team needs to ramp up the mentorship program quickly. The sheer number of employees eligible to retire should signla to upper management a dire need to start recruiting ASAP. The number of engineers and senior engineers eligible to retire is staggering and represents a vast pool of knowledge that could soon be retiring. Mentorship, knowledge transfer, and recruiting need to be made a top priority.
